# Two months

Most of the work for the past month has been about figuring out
how the web application should work: what approach to use,
which tools to use and how to get everything working together.

Most parts of the web application are working now, next it's time
to work on the CI functionality.

# Web app

There is now a barebones [single page web application](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)
that provides an overview of the package repository and its content. The web application is very incomplete and
needs some gfx love but technically it's already good enough.

The web app is (hopefully) flexible and easily maintainable so adding new new web features should be easy.
It's also very fast, fastest JSON requests complete in under 10ms (on local machine).

The web app uses a simple templating system to render AJAX data and there is also pushstate support
and bookmarkable urls so the app should behave in a userfriendly way.

JSON api provides access to the metadata in the repository. The JSON api is
used by the web app to get data and it can be used to implement other client applications that use the data.

The web app can serve static resource files and convert them on the fly (currently there is support for
SASS and Coffeescript). And finally, there are testing tools to run automated unit and functional tests for
the web application, Ruby and Javascript code.

# Homegrown

Ki-flow is going to be distributed as a [ki-repo](https://github.com/mikko-apo/ki-repo) package.
Ki-repo provides the API and the command line tools to start up the ki-flow web application
with a simple command:

    ki web -u ki/flow

When the "ki web" command starts up, it looks for the latest available version of "ki/flow".
"ki web" loads all ki/flow Ruby files tagged with "ki". The Ruby files can register web classes
to different web site routes, for example Ki::RepositoryWeb is registered to "/repository"
and Ki::StaticFileWeb handles static files from a different route.

Once the server has started the application is available at http://localhost:8290/repository

## Single page web application

Single page apps are blazingly fast. Ki-flow loads only small JSON files and rendering new views
is a very straightforward process.

All the files and templates are loaded by the main page. Javascript loads
data from the JSON api with AJAX and renders a view to the page by filling templates with the data.
When the user clicks a link, Javascript code renders another view.

The source code for the main page is available at:

https://github.com/mikko-apo/ki-flow/blob/master/lib/web/views/repository_page.erb

A simple Sinatra application serves the pages and the JSON data. Most of the data is already
available in JSON and ki-repo gem provides handy api to access the data:

* [lib/web/repository.rb](https://github.com/mikko-apo/ki-flow/blob/master/lib/web/repository.rb)

The main javascript logic is in coffeescript which contains functions that render the different views:

* [lib/web/views/repository.coffee](https://github.com/mikko-apo/ki-flow/blob/master/lib/web/views/repository.coffee)

Automated tests for the different views are written in javascript. They're integrated to the
Ruby tests: a single test sets up a repository, starts the web application, starts a browser
and runs the tests:

* [lib/web/views/repository_js_test.coffee](https://github.com/mikko-apo/ki-flow/blob/master/lib/web/views/repository_js_test.coffee)
* [spec/web_repository_spec.rb](https://github.com/mikko-apo/ki-flow/blob/master/spec/web_repository_spec.rb)

## Javascript utilities

renderElements() - Fills an html template with data and attaches functionality. Each key-value
pair from data is rendered separately by looking for an element that matches the key and
filling the value in. Value can be either text or a function or both. Text is set as such, but
function is applied to the found element.

    this.show_component = (component) ->
      $.get "/repository/json/component/#{component}/versions", (data) ->
        clear()
        # #fi-component template contains two elements:
        # - .componentName
        # - .components is a link back to main page
        renderElements "#content", "#t-component",
          componentName: component,
          components: (n) -> n.click -> show_components()
        # data is a list of versions: {"id": "2","time": "2013-01-03 00:31:33 +0200"}
        renderElements "#version-list", "#t-version", data, (k, v, n) -> n.click -> show_version(component, v)

assertElements() - Asserts that all key-values pairs are found from page.

    describe '/repository', ->
      it "/component/X", ->
        show_component 'my/component'
        assertElements
          "componentName": "my/component",
          "#version-list p": "23"
        show_component 'my/product'
        assertElements
          "componentName": "my/product",
          "#version-list p": "2"

# Tools

[Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) is a minimalistic framework for creating web applications in Ruby.
It provides a good base for ki-flow because it comes with an extensive set of features and extensions.
Sinatra is based on [Rack](http://rack.github.com/) and all Rack extensions are also available.

To help with HTML app development [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/) is a nice
Ruby-influenced language that compiles to Javascript and [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/)
makes CSS development a joy. Both of them help to keep the code size down while
providing useful features.

[jQuery](http://jquery.com/) is a vital part of the Javascript stack.

[Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha) with [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) provide
an [RSpec](http://rspec.info/) like test syntax for writing JS tests and
[Selenium WebDriver](http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/RubyBindings) is used to
runs the JS tests automatically in browser.
